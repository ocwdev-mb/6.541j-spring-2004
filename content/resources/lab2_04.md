  synthesis of speech with a

  terminal-analog speech synthesizer. This synthesizer, which is implemented on the
  computers of

  the speech group running Linux, consists of an array of sources and filters that
  simulate the

  acoustic sources and transfer functions that describe human speech generation.'
